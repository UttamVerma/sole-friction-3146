              Is it necessary to have financial tracking software?
            </summary>
            <p>
              It depends on the complexity of your financial transactions and
              your personal or business goals. For individuals or businesses
              with simple financial transactions and goals, manual tracking may
              be sufficient. However, as financial transactions become more
              complex, and the number of transactions increases, financial
              tracking software can save time and ensure accuracy. Additionally,
              for those who want to gain a deeper understanding of their
              finances, financial tracking software can provide valuable
              insights and analysis.
